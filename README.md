A Minecraft Clone in LWJGL 3

If you are in the programming club don't fork yet! (I'm adding a major basic game engine change).

Check out https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/ for help with LWJGL 3 (I'm adding the chapter 2 game engine)

Use as an eclipse project and launch Start file as Java Program

# WARNING

Use `-XstartOnFirstThread` VM argument on macs
